I am also enrolled in a summer class called Library and Information Sciences 510, which is all about children's books and the importance of reading to your children and your students. \n\nThis upcoming semester I will be continuing all the aforementioned activities while also starting my Pre-Practicum in the Teacher Education Program since I was admitted this past semester. Another exciting thing that I get to be a part of the year, is the beginning of a Special Olympics club! Some of my friends and I were talking about how weird it is that such a large university does not have a Special Olympics club, so we decided to start one.

Since my break is almost over, I thought it is time I write to update you! This semester I received a 3.6 GPA and thoroughly enjoyed my classes. It is exciting that I am finally in classes that are beginning to tailor to my major. My favorite class was EDP 202, which is Educational Developmental Psychology, and during the semester I got 10 observation hours in a third grade classroom. \n\nIn terms of my campus involvement, I am still very active in my sorority, and I am now both the Intramural chair and the House Manager. This semester I played on two basketball teams, one for my sorority and a CoRec team with a bunch of my friends. I have also recently joined another club in addition to the Kentucky Education Association, that is called the Elementary Education Student Association. I am very excited about this club because we work closely with the local Elementary schools and often go volunteer or have teacher panels come speak to us. I also volunteer at the Lexington Public Library once or twice a week in the Homework Help Program, which benefits children whose parents are at work or those who speak a language other than English. I work with 3-5 kids each session, from various ages, with any type of homework assignment, so it keeps me on my toes and allows me to practice tutoring in multiple subjects. \n\nI am very excited for the upcoming semester because I will not only get to continue all of this, but I will also be able to volunteer in DanceBlue. DanceBlue is a 24-hour dance Marathon that typically happens in February, and all the proceeds go to the University's Children's Hematology and Oncology Clinic. Last year our student body raised $1,785,286.96, and although my back issues will not permit me to stand or dance for 24 hours straight, I am still very excited to have the opportunity to volunteer for 5 hours during the marathon. \n\nAs far as my classes are concerned, I am taking a Spanish class, an Honors class, Art Education, Math Education, and Physics for Education majors. I have a feeling this is going to be a difficult semester but I am up for the challenge. \n\n*Thanks for the update McKenzie!*",
