		"Text": "The Ewell \u201CJudge\u201D Waddell Endowed Scholarship Fund has received gifts from the Waddell family that will double the size of the Scholarship\u2019s endowment. According to the Fund\u2019s Chair, William Waddell, $150,000 will be received immediately. The total endowment is now over $300,000, which will permanently fund the current level of spending.\n\nThe Waddell Scholarship was established in 2004 as a tribute to Highlands head football coach and later Superintendent of Ft. Thomas Schools Ewell E. \u201CJudge\u201D Waddell. Coach Waddell was a beloved and respected figure in Ft. Thomas from 1940 until his untimely death in 1967. Recipients of the Scholarship are chosen on the basis of a sincere interest in teaching and coaching, and demonstrated character and leadership ability. More than $50,000 in scholarship awards have been made since the fund\u2019s inception.\n\nDale Mueller, former Highlands coach and athletic director, and member of the Scholarship\u2019s Advisory Committee, said \u201Cthis scholarship and ones like it are vitally important in encouraging Highlands seniors toward teaching and coaching careers. Our young people deserve the best teacher\/coaches possible, and this is an ingredient in making that happen.\u201D ",

His main entry as a senior is on page 25 of the Talisman.\n\nHe was also in two clubs, on the Talisman staff, played football, and managed basketball. But also found was that he was voted most popular boy. Additional entries for him are on the following pages: 27, 88, 99, 106, 122, 126. \n\n Here is a link to the 1934 Talisman on TopScholar: [http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/348](http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/348) Click on the link, then click on \"Download\" on the right side of the screen to go to the scan of the 1934 Talisman.\n\nAdditional documents, including previous years' Talismans are also available on TopScholar. The link below leads to a date-ordered list of documents. Scroll down to get to 1934, and use the numbers and arrows at the very bottom to navigate to earlier years. You can also use the search box in the upper left corner to search for him by name in TopScholar.

The catalog is also online and can be reached at kencat.wku.edu.\n\nAlso found in the \"humor\" section of the Talisman is this gem from the \"class will\": \n\n![](http://www.judgewaddell.org/Content/img/class-will.png)\n\nThe Judge Waddell advisory board thanks April McCauley for sending us this information!
