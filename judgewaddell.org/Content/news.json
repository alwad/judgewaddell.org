		"Date": "November 23, 2020",
		"Text": "The Ewell \u201CJudge\u201D Waddell Endowed Scholarship Fund has received gifts from the Waddell family that will potentially more than double the size of the Scholarship\u2019s endowment. According to the Fund\u2019s Chair, William Waddell, $100,000 will be received immediately. Another $50,000 will be in the form of a matching grant, so that any gift received by the Fund from other sources by December 31, 2020 will be matched by the grant up to a total of $50,000. Thus the total addition to the Scholarship fund could reach $200, 000, more than doubling the size of its current endowment. Mr. Waddell said the gift \u201Cwould insure that the Scholarship is available on a permanent basis for Highlands graduating seniors\u201D. \n\nThe Waddell Scholarship was established in 2004 as a tribute to Highlands head football coach and later Superintendent of Ft. Thomas Schools Ewell E. \u201CJudge\u201D Waddell. Coach Waddell was a beloved and respected figure in Ft. Thomas from 1940 until his untimely death in 1967. Recipients of the Scholarship are chosen on the basis of a sincere interest in teaching and coaching, and demonstrated character and leadership ability. More than $50,000 in scholarship awards have been made since the fund\u2019s inception.\n\nDale Mueller, former Highlands coach and athletic director, and member of the Scholarship\u2019s Advisory Committee, said \u201Cthis scholarship and ones like it are vitally important in encouraging Highlands seniors toward teaching and coaching careers. Our young people deserve the best teacher\/coaches possible, and this is an ingredient in making that happen.\u201D ",

		"Text": "This past semester I earned a 4.0 while still being involved in my sorority, being House Manager for the sorority house, and Intramural chair for my sorority. I also participated in various Intramural sports and have continued volunteering at the Lexington Public Library's Homework Help Center. I am also enrolled in a summer class called Library and Information Sciences 510, which is all about children's books and the importance of reading to your children and your students. \n\nThis upcoming semester I will be continuing all the aforementioned activities while also starting my Pre-Practicum in the Teacher Education Program since I was admitted this past semester. Another exciting thing that I get to be a part of the year, is the beginning of a Special Olympics club! Some of my friends and I were talking about how weird it is that such a large university does not have a Special Olympics club, so we decided to start one. As of a couple days ago, we are officially a club at UK!\n\n*Thanks for the update McKenzie!*",

		"Text": "(We got an update from McKenzie earlier this year, but forgot to post it!)\n\nI hope you enjoyed your Christmas season and had a happy new year! Since my break is almost over, I thought it is time I write to update you! This semester I received a 3.6 GPA and thoroughly enjoyed my classes. It is exciting that I am finally in classes that are beginning to tailor to my major. My favorite class was EDP 202, which is Educational Developmental Psychology, and during the semester I got 10 observation hours in a third grade classroom. \n\nIn terms of my campus involvement, I am still very active in my sorority, and I am now both the Intramural chair and the House Manager. This semester I played on two basketball teams, one for my sorority and a CoRec team with a bunch of my friends. I have also recently joined another club in addition to the Kentucky Education Association, that is called the Elementary Education Student Association. I am very excited about this club because we work closely with the local Elementary schools and often go volunteer or have teacher panels come speak to us. I also volunteer at the Lexington Public Library once or twice a week in the Homework Help Program, which benefits children whose parents are at work or those who speak a language other than English. I work with 3-5 kids each session, from various ages, with any type of homework assignment, so it keeps me on my toes and allows me to practice tutoring in multiple subjects. \n\nI am very excited for the upcoming semester because I will not only get to continue all of this, but I will also be able to volunteer in DanceBlue. DanceBlue is a 24-hour dance Marathon that typically happens in February, and all the proceeds go to the University's Children's Hematology and Oncology Clinic. Last year our student body raised $1,785,286.96, and although my back issues will not permit me to stand or dance for 24 hours straight, I am still very excited to have the opportunity to volunteer for 5 hours during the marathon. \n\nAs far as my classes are concerned, I am taking a Spanish class, an Honors class, Art Education, Math Education, and Physics for Education majors. I have a feeling this is going to be a difficult semester but I am up for the challenge. \n\n*Thanks for the update McKenzie!*",

		"Text": "Since summer has officially started and I am now finally finished with my first year of college, I thought that I would write to you. This past Spring semester I received a 3.8 GPA. I had my very first Education class (EDS 375, which is about teaching Special Education) and I learned so much not only about Special Education, but about Education in general and how certain things can translate over to the general classroom. \n\nMy sorority had our big philanthropy event this semester as well, which was a 5k run called the Shamrock Shuffle. We raised $32,852 for The Nest Center for Women and Children in Lexington. Essentially, The Nest is a place where women and their children can go to receive any care or counseling that they may need to get back on their feet after losing a job, getting out of an abusive relationship, or anything of the nature. \n\nI am very excited for next semester because I will be completely into all my education courses since I have finished all of my remaining general education courses. The class I'm most excited about is my EDP 202 class because I already get to start observing classes in Lexington Elementary schools while learning about their behavior and child development. \n\nThis summer I am working as a nanny for a local family Monday-Friday from 7:30 to 5:00, and am having so much fun with the three girls! \n\nI hope you have a wonderful summer and can enjoy the good weather! \n\nThank you again for your support, \nMcKenzie \n\n\n*Thanks for the update McKenzie!*",

His main entry as a senior is on page 25 of the Talisman.\n\nHe was also in two clubs, on the Talisman staff, played football, and managed basketball. But also found was that he was voted most popular boy. Additional entries for him are on the following pages: 27, 88, 99, 106, 122, 126. \n\n Here is a link to the 1934 Talisman on TopScholar: [http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/348](http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/348) Click on the link, then click on \"Download\" on the right side of the screen to go to the scan of the 1934 Talisman.\n\nAdditional documents, including previous years' Talismans are also available on TopScholar. The link below leads to a date-ordered list of documents. Scroll down to get to 1934, and use the numbers and arrows at the very bottom to navigate to earlier years. You can also use the search box in the upper left corner to search for him by name in TopScholar.

The catalog is also online and can be reached at kencat.wku.edu.\n\nAlso found in the \"humor\" section of the Talisman is this gem from the \"class will\": \n\n![](http://www.judgewaddell.org/Content/img/class-will.png)\n\nThe Judge Waddell advisory board thanks April McCauley for sending us this information!
