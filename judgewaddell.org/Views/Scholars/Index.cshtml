					<h2> Brady Dowling</h2>
					<p>
						Played center for the Bluebirds football team and was elected
						captain his senior year. A real leader, Brady was a Freshman and
						Freshman Football Mentor in 2007-08, and received the Leader of
						Champions award in 2008. Brady received his B.A. and Masters Degrees
						from the University of Kentucky, in English and Educational Administration.
						He tutored students at Henry Clay High School, worked in the front office
						of the Lexington Legends (AA) baseball club, and did his student teaching
						in the Fayette County Public School System, all in and around Lexington.
					</p>
					<p>In 2013, he became the first Waddell Scholar to accept a full-time teaching position in the Ft. Thomas system. In the fall semester he will teach pre-AP English at Highlands. We are proud to have Brady become the first of our scholars to come home to Highlands. </p>
					<p>In recalling his own formative years, Brady notes the "outstanding education the Highlands teachers and staff gave me in preparing me for writing and planning for exams", as well as the lesson "that friends and outside influences are just as important as having a good education. The social experience I had at Highlands...made it a seamless transition from high school to college. Being a part of the football team was also huge for me; football made me mentally and physically tough while also affording me...lifelong friends". </p>

					<h2>Sydney Hiance</h2>
					<p>
						Starred at soccer at Highlands and at the University of Kentucky as
						goalkeeper. At Highlands she compiled an incredible record, with a goals
						against average of 0.20 her senior year, and was named, among other things,
						Gatorade Kentucky Player of the Year and Cincinnati Enquirer Player of the
						Year. At Kentucky she compiled one of the best shutout records in U.K.

					</p>
					<p>
						When we asked how she felt about her Highlands preparation, Sydney said,
						"I think Highlands more than prepared me for my college career both as an
						athlete and also as a student. It is hard for me to believe that I would
						be where I am now without the help from the wonderful people at Highlands
						and especially my soccer coach Nina Kearns".
